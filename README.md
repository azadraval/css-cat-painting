# Cat Painting Project

This is my cat painting project, created as part of the freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design certification. I built a detailed cat face illustration using only HTML and CSS positioning techniques.

## Project Overview

The Cat Painting project helped me master CSS positioning by creating a complex illustration with multiple nested elements. By arranging and styling div elements with precise positioning, I created a cute cat face with detailed features.

## What I Learned

Through this project, I practiced:
- Using CSS positioning methods (relative, absolute, fixed)
- Working with nested elements and parent-child relationships
- Implementing transform properties for rotations and adjustments
- Creating organic shapes with border-radius
- Using z-index to control element stacking
- Applying gradients and shadows for dimension
- Breaking down a complex design into manageable components
- Using CSS variables for consistent styling

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3

## Project Structure

- `index.html` - The HTML structure with nested divs for each part of the cat
- `styles.css` - The CSS file that positions and styles each element to create the cat illustration

## Design Elements

The cat painting features:
- Realistic cat ears with inner ear details
- Expressive eyes with pupils and highlights
- A triangular nose with shading
- Whiskers positioned at different angles
- A subtle mouth with curved lines
- Proper layering of elements for a cohesive look
- Careful color choices to create a cute character

This project was challenging but incredibly rewarding as it showed me how powerful CSS positioning can be for creating illustrations. I learned to appreciate the precision required in positioning elements and how small adjustments can dramatically change the appearance of the final design.
